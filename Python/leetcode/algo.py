Task
The function is given a string with lower-case characters. Split the string into as many substrings as possible such that each character appears in only one substring. 
Return the list of lengths of the resulting substrings.

Examples
"abbccc" ➞ [1, 2, 3]
# "a", "bb", "ccc"

"abbacdceef" ➞ [4, 3, 2, 1]
# "abba", "cdc", "ee", "f"

"abacded" ➞ [3, 1, 3]
# "aba", "c", "ded"

"abcdea" ➞ [6]
# "abcdea" because first letter is equal to the last letter.

        You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.
        Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at 
        most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.
        A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

        Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
        Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
        {"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
